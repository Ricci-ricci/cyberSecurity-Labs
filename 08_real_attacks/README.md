# 08 - Real Attacks Demonstration

This module demonstrates real-world attack vectors and infection methods, such as the vector of the K985ytv infection.

## Overview

These scripts are inspired by the book "Violent Python" by TJ O'Connor. I learned a lot from this book and highly recommend it: https://www.nostarch.com/violentpython.

The goal is to show how real attacks work, including infection vectors, to better understand and defend against them.

## Disclaimer

**For Educational Purposes Only.** Do not use these scripts on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test. Real attacks like K985ytv can cause significant harm, and replicating them without authorization is illegal.

## Topics Covered

- **Infection Vectors**: Examples of how malware spreads, like the K985ytv worm's methods.
- **Exploit Demos**: Simplified scripts showing vulnerable code or attack techniques.
- **Defense Insights**: Understanding these helps in building better security.

## Usage

Run the scripts in a controlled environment only.

*Note: Ensure you have authorization before testing any exploits.*
