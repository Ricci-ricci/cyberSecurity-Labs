# Python Exploitation & Port Scanning Project

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and modules focused on network exploitation, port scanning, and security tools. It is structured as a learning path, starting from fundamentals and moving towards more complex security concepts.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several modules:

### Modules

- **`01_fundamentals/`**: Basic Python concepts applied to networking and security.
- **`02_portScanning/`**: Detailed exploration of port scanning techniques and implementations.
- **`03_bannerGrabbing/`**: Scripts for retrieving service banners to identify running applications.
- **`04_bruteForce/`**: Tools demonstrating brute-force techniques (use responsibly and only on authorized systems).
- **`05_defensiveTools/`**: Scripts focusing on defensive programming and security monitoring.
- **`06_webSecurity/`**: Tools related to web application security scanning and analysis.
- **`07_labs/`**: Practical exercises and experimental scripts.

## Usage

To run the main port scanner:

```bash
python3 portScanner.py
```

*Note: Please ensure you have authorization before scanning any network or system.*

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Standard Python libraries (socket, threading, optparse)

## a lot of script are inspired by the book Violent Python by TJ O'Connor
## i learned a lot from this book and i really recommend it
