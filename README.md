# Python Exploitation & Port Scanning Project

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and modules focused on network exploitation, port scanning, and security tools. It is structured as a learning path, starting from fundamentals and moving towards more complex security concepts.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several modules:

### Modules

- **`01_fundamentals/`**: Basic Python concepts applied to networking and security.
- **`02_portScanning/`**: Detailed exploration of port scanning techniques and implementations.
- **`03_bannerGrabbing/`**: Scripts for retrieving service banners to identify running applications.
- **`04_bruteForce/`**: Tools demonstrating brute-force techniques (use responsibly and only on authorized systems).
- **`05_defensiveTools/`**: Scripts focusing on defensive programming and security monitoring.
- **`06_webSecurity/`**: Tools related to web application security scanning and analysis.
- **`07_labs/`**: Practical exercises and experimental scripts.
- **`08_real_attacks/`**: Demonstrations of real-world attack vectors and infection methods.

## Usage

To run the main port scanner:

```bash
python3 portScanner.py
```

*Note: Please ensure you have authorization before scanning any network or system.*

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Standard Python libraries (socket, threading, optparse)

## Inspiration & Learning Resources

Many scripts in this repository are inspired by the following excellent books:

### Violent Python by TJ O'Connor
A foundational book for Python-based security tools and network exploitation techniques.
- https://www.nostarch.com/violentpython

### Black Hat Python, 2nd Edition by Justin Seitz & Tim Arnold
An advanced guide to Python for penetration testers and security professionals.
- https://nostarch.com/black-hat-python-2nd-edition

### Python Web Penetration Testing Cookbook by Cameron Buchanan et al.
Comprehensive recipes for web application security testing using Python.

I learned a tremendous amount from these books and highly recommend them to anyone interested in security automation and Python programming.
