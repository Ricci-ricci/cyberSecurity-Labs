# 01 - Fundamentals

This directory contains the foundational scripts and examples for understanding Python's role in network security and exploitation.

## Overview

Before diving into complex scanning and exploitation tools, it is crucial to understand the building blocks. This module covers:

- **Python Basics**: Syntax and structures relevant to security scripting.
- **Socket Programming**: Introduction to the `socket` library, the core of network communication in Python.
- **Data Handling**: Basic encoding and decoding of network data.

## Goal

The goal of this section is to become comfortable with creating simple connections and handling data streams, which are prerequisites for writing port scanners and other network tools.
