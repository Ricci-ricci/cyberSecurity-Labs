# 04 - Brute Force Tools

This module explores methods and scripts for performing brute-force attacks against network services.

## Overview

Brute-forcing involves systematically checking all possible passwords or keys until the correct one is found. In this context, we focus on online brute-force attacks against services like SSH, FTP, or Telnet.

## Topics Covered

- **Dictionary Attacks**: Using wordlists to guess credentials based on common passwords.
- **Service Authentication**: Interacting with specific protocols (e.g., FTP via `ftplib`, SSH via `paramiko`) to attempt programmatic logins.
- **Threaded Cracking**: Using multi-threading to increase the speed of the attack attempts.

## Disclaimer

**Strictly Educational Use Only.**
Brute-forcing credentials on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test is illegal and unethical. These scripts are intended for testing the strength of your own passwords or auditing systems within a controlled lab environment.
