# 07 - Labs

This directory serves as a sandbox for experimental scripts, exercises, and practical challenges.

## Overview

The "Labs" module is where theory meets practice. It contains a variety of scripts that don't fit neatly into the other categories or are designed as specific challenges to test your skills.

## Contents

- **Experimental Scripts**: Proof-of-concept code that explores new ideas or libraries.
- **Challenges**: Practice exercises designed to reinforce the concepts learned in previous modules (e.g., "Build a scanner that does X").
- **Integration Tests**: Scripts that combine multiple techniques (e.g., scanning ports, then grabbing banners, then checking a web page).

## How to Use

Use this space to:
1. Try out your own modifications to existing tools.
2. Store your solutions to security challenges.
3. prototype new features before moving them into the main modules.

## Note

Code in this directory may be less polished or stable than in the core modules. It is a workspace for learning and iteration.
