# 05 - Defensive Tools

This directory shifts focus from offensive scanning to defensive monitoring and security scripting.

## Overview

Understanding how to defend systems is just as important as knowing how to exploit them. This module provides scripts and tools designed to detect scanning activity, analyze logs, and harden system security.

## Topics Covered

- **Log Analysis**: Parsing system and application logs to identify suspicious patterns or potential attacks.
- **Simple Intrusion Detection**: Creating basic listeners or honeypots to detect when a port scan occurs against the localhost.
- **Network Monitoring**: Observing traffic or connection attempts to identify unauthorized access.
- **Scripting for Defense**: Automating security checks and alerts.

## Goal

The objective is to learn how to write Python scripts that can aid a system administrator or security analyst in monitoring the health and security status of a network.
